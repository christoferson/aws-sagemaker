Markdowns are crucial to promoting sales especially before key events such as Super Bowl, Christmas and Thanksgiving.


##### Bias & Variance Tradeoff

Underfitting
Overfitting - Algorithm models the training data too perfectly. e.g. memorizing the answers. Fails to generalize or performs poorly on actual data.

Linear Model - High Bias, Low Variance, Good Generalization
High Order Polynomial  - Low Bias, High Variance, Overfitted


##### Ridge Regression

Overfitting - Algorithm is very good in predicting training data but performs poorly on test data.

Ridge Regression - Attempt to increase the bias to improve variance. Add Alpha times Square of Slope to decouple independent variable.
